# LoadTestSim
Simulates a resource usage in a performance testing environment.
# 8/30/2018 Initial Readme.md
#
Problem to be solved: Finding best algorithms to provision resources for performance tests where:
- The DUT (device under test) is a load balancer and requires resources (Test Harness) to drive the load required for both client and server.
- Track the use of all resources and report how much of the time was spent in actual test ie, driving client and server load.
- Track the amount of time a set of test runs takes, be able to ramdomize order of testing
- Allow for the testing of what if scenarios
- Prioritize tests
